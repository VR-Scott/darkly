# Where:
    /.hidden
# How:

-By browsing /.hidden we find lots of files that would be tedious to search.

-We make a script to search through these files for the flag.


# Flag:
    99dde1d35d1fdd283924d84e6d9f1d820

# Possible abuses:

If you don't protect files they can be accessed by users.

# Fix:

Block direct access to directories or files using a .htaccess or similar file
